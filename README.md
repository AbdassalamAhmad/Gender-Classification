## About the Dataset
#### Data Source
I've used 2 datasets:
* https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/gender-recognition-200k-images-celeba
* https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

#### Dataset Information
The first dataset contains over 200K images of males and females without over cropping faces<br>
